# Data-Analysis-with-Python
## Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
### What is Data Analysis?
A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information,
informing conclusion and supporting decision-making. 
Python is very simple and intuitive to learn, "correct" language, has powerful libraries, is free and open source and has amazing community.
Sometimes R is better than Python: when dealing with advanced statistical methods, when extreme performance is needed. 
Data Extraction --> Data Cleaning --> Data Wrangling --> Analysis --> Action
In real world the process isn't linear. Usually we're skipping back and forth between these steps.
### Jupyter
What is the difference between Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab. Jupyter Lab is just a nicer interface on top of Jupyter Notebook. It is the evolution of Jupyter Notebook. In previous tutorials I was working in Visual Studio Code and I was using Jupyter Notebooks. Why do we use Jupyter Notebook? Because it's an interactive real time environment to produce or to explore our data analysis. It's a tool you're gonna fire commands, and it will immediately responds with something back. It's very interactive tool. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Jupyter Lab are both popular development environments, but they have different use cases and design philosophies. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose text editor and integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used for a wide range of programming languages, including Python. It has a rich set of features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and version control integration. VSCode is designed to be fast, lightweight, and highly customizable, making it a popular choice among developers for day-to-day coding tasks. Jupyter Lab, on the other hand, is a web-based interactive development environment specifically designed for data science and scientific computing. It is built on the Jupyter Notebook, a tool for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Lab provides a full suite of tools for working with data, including support for multiple programming languages, a powerful file explorer, and interactive widgets for building user interfaces. In summary, VSCode is a versatile text editor that is well-suited for a wide range of programming tasks, while Jupyter Lab is a specialized environment for data science and scientific computing. The choice between the two will depend on your specific needs and the tasks you are trying to accomplish. In Jupyter there is command mode and edit mode, you can also add code or you can add markdown just like in Jupyter.
### NumPy
NumPy is a very efficient numeric processing library, that sits on top of Python, and gives you the same APIs as you're going to work with
just writing and typing code.

### Pandas
The two main data structures in Pandas are Series for 1-D data and DataFrame for 2-D data. Data in higher dimensions are supported within DataFrame using a concept called hierarchical indexing.

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data wrangling, is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data. This is a crucial step in the data science process as it helps to ensure that the results of any analysis or modeling are based on high-quality data.
